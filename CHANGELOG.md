# Changelog

### v0.18.1
#### New Features:
Adds support for:
- SQL Server down to version 2012 
- authentication via:
    - Azure CLI (see #71, thanks @JCZuurmond !), and
    - MSFT ODBC Active Directory options (#53 #55 #58 thanks to @NandanHegde15 and @alieus) 
- using a named instance (#51 thanks @alangsbo)
- Adds support down to SQL Server 2012
- The adapter is now automatically tested with Fishtowns official adapter-tests to increase stability when making 
changes and upgrades to the adapter.

#### Fixes:
- Fix for lack of precision in the snapshot check strategy. Previously when executing two check snapshots the same
second, there was inconsistent data as a result. This was mostly noted when running the automatic adapter tests. 
NOTE: This fix will create a new snapshot version in the target table
on first run after upgrade.
